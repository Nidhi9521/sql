-- -   Tables Used:=
    
--     -	student  (studentid, name)

--     -   studentdetail (studentdetailid, studentid, standard, gender)

--     -   studentpresent (studentpresentid, studentid, month, present)

--     -   studenthours (studenthoursid, studentid, datex, hours)

--     -   product (productid, name)

--     -   productprice (productpriceid, productid, code, effdt, price)


-- 	- Write a query to display all the product names with code in bracket in one column and 2 decimal significant price in second column, 
-- 	e.g. : MS Sql book (MS09210) | 10.99

-- 	Here 'MS Sql book' is product name and 'MSSQL09210' is the product code while '10.99' is the 2 decimal significant price.
SELECT name||' ('||code||')' as productName,round(price,2) as price from product INNER join productPrice on product.productId=productPrice.productId
	
-- 	- Write a query to display following information separated by comma in a single row for the students who have atleast one 'a' in their name. 
-- 	The column heading should be STUDENTINFO.
	
-- 	student name, standard, gender
SELECT name||','||standard||','||gender as studentData from student INNER join studentDetail on student.studentId=studentDetail.studentId
